"""macOS DMG builder for FancyClock.

Requires macOS with Xcode command-line tools and Homebrew.
Run from the repository root with the venv active:
    python builddmg.py

Notarization is mandatory. A Developer ID signature alone is not enough: since
macOS 10.15 Gatekeeper rejects signed-but-unnotarized apps with "Apple could not
verify ... is free of malware". APPLE_ID and APPLE_APP_PASSWORD must be set or
the build stops before doing any work.

Env vars:
    APPLE_ID                  : Apple ID for notarization (required)
    APPLE_APP_PASSWORD        : app-specific password for notarization (required)
    DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION  : override the default signing identity
    APPLE_TEAM_ID             : Team ID for notarization (defaults to W7K465GKFJ)
    ALLOW_UNNOTARIZED         : set to 1 to build without notarizing. The result
                                is for local testing only and must never be
                                published as a release artifact.
